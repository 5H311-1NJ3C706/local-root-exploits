 glibc - 'getcwd()' Local Privilege Escalation 2018 local root exploit
===============
local root exploit for linux

 *  This tool exploits a buffer underflow in glibc realpath()
 *  and was tested against latest release from Debian, Ubuntu
 *  Mint. It is intended as demonstration of ASLR-aware exploitation
 *  techniques. It uses relative binary offsets, that may be different
 *  for various Linux distributions and builds. Please send me
 *  a patch when you developed a new set of parameters to add
 *  to the osSpecificExploitDataList structure and want to contribute
 *  them.
 *
 *  Compile: gcc -o RationalLove RationalLove.c
 *  Run: ./RationalLove
 *
 *  You may also use "--Pid" parameter, if you want to test the
 *  program on already existing namespaced or chrooted mounts.
